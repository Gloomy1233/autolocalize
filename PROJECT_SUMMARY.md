# AutoLocalize - Android Localization Library

## Short Description

**AutoLocalize** is a production-ready Android library that simplifies multi-language app development by combining Android's native resource localization with on-device ML translation. It provides instant locale switching, a customizable language picker UI, and automatic translation of dynamic content (backend/user-generated text).

## Elevator Pitch

AutoLocalize enables Android developers to create truly multilingual apps with minimal effort. It handles both traditional `strings.xml` localization and runtime translation of dynamic content, all with a beautiful, customizable language picker UI. Perfect for apps with mixed static and dynamic content that need offline translation capabilities.

## Key Value Propositions

✅ **Instant Language Switching** - No app restart required
